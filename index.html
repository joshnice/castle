                    <p>
                        We offer a free no obligation survey to all property owners. We have a small marketing team who will arrange these surveys in particular areas for a limited time. 
                        This way we can utilise the time of our surveyors. There is NO charge for these surveys as we use our advertising budget to cover the cost. We find that people 
                        tend to come back to use our services in the future after learning how professional, honest and friendly we are. We gain a lot of recommendations from these surveys 
                        and, in our opinion, word of mouth is the best form of advertising you can have.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These surveys are for all property owners with a house over the age of 30 years. They are not just for people with visual signs of issues. Over 70% of the surveys 
                        that are completed are dry and given the all clear which give the house owner peace of mind. If any issues are picked up during the survey, the surveyors will explain
                        the cause and advise of the most appropriate course of action to eliminate the issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The surveys usually take around 30 minutes if no issues are detected. If any problems are found it will take a little longer to correctly diagnose and advise. These 
                        surveys are non destructive and are done on the internal walls of the property. A visual check of the exterior will be carried out to check for masonry damage, leaking
                        guttering etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The results of these surveys will be left verbally with the house owners and not passed onto any third parties. No personal information will be passed onto or sold to third parties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have arranged a survey through one of our marketing team you will receive a phone call prior to your appointment time to confirm we are running to the allotted timetable. 
                        Please be advised that these surveys are very popular and sometimes re-arrangements may need to be made.  We will also  inform you of the name of the surveyor who will be calling. 
                        All our surveyors and marketing staff carry photo identification. If in any doubt please call 0800 345 70 83.

                                Damp proofing is an overarching term that covers several different types of damp that can
                                occur in a property and the way in which it is treated. We treat almost all known causes of
                                damp within properties and repair the property to a pre decoration standard. All the works
                                carried out are decided upon between the customer and the company before works begin
                                and our trusted teams of fitters can answer any of the queries you may have on site. If you
                                have concerns about your property and would value a second opinion, contact us now and
                                we can arrange a visit.

                                Rising damp is caused by the drawing of moisture from the ground into the walls of the
                                property this water travels through the brickwork, via capillaries (small holes), like a
                                network of tunnels soaking all the works in its path; meaning that any plasterworks or
                                timberwork will also suffer from damp. The treatment involves a chemical injection into the
                                motar course, also known as the damp proofing course or DPC, and in some instances a
                                membrane is required to further protect the plasterworks. Depending on the age or the
                                property there may or may not be a DPC already installed in the walls, however these can
                                fail over time especially the older treatments and therefore the walls are no longer
                                protected.

                                Rising damp can be easier identified on the internal walls of a property by
                                water marks on the wall that seem to resemble marks of the water level, such as markings
                                of the tide on the side of a cliff. These water marks can be paired with salt markings that
                                also travel through the water and cause damage to the plaster; which can be seen in the
                                bubbling of paintwork, loosening of wallpaper or even the complete deterioration of the
                                plasterworks themselves.

                                This type of damp is the result of water ingress or infiltration through a hole created by a

                                gotten to an age where the degrading has forced it to become porous this would allow
                                water in constantly at a certain point of the wall, this means that -unlike rising damp- the
                                water isn't drawn up the wall but soaking through. This type of damp can lead to similar
                                issues seen with rising damp such as damage to the structure of the wall and damage to the
                                make-up of the internal property but can also lead to rotting of timbers due to the constant
                                moisture entering the property.

                                such as paint or paper falling off is not uncommon, however, the damage will not be at the
                                base of the wall necessary as seen with rising damp; it could be anywhere along the wall or
                                even ceiling. This follows with the issue of water or damp marks on the wall instead of

                                In contrary to the name this type of rotting will mainly occur in damp timber, it is a fungal
                                assault on the timber that causes severe structural damage to the wood and therefore the
                                property as well. It causes the wood to go very brittle and can cause subsequent issues to
                                the floor or structure that it was supporting. It can be caused by a dry rot spore which can
                                grow given the right environment- such as oxygen, correct temperature and access to a food
                                source, or via cross contamination from another source either whilst in state in the property
                                or prior to installation. One of the main concerns of dry rot is that it can travel through inert
                                materials and thus can cover a larger area.

                                In order to find the rot, you must first expose the timber which could
                                most likely be affected; this means that you will need to go into the sub floor or loft of the
                                property in order to get a perspective of the whole problem. This can arise its own issues
                                when properties do not have a cellar or loft, these issues are mitigated by the surveyors if
                                an issue is suspected. One of the key signs of dry rot is fungal or mycelium growth in the
                                timber which is said to resemble cotton wool, a white stringy substance. Another indication
                                is smell, dry rot leaves a damp, musty smell within the property. Another tell tale sign of ry
                                rot is the brick red spores that become prevalent as well as deep cuboidal cracking of the
                                timber itself. If you think you have seen or smelt any issues do not hesitate to give our

                                This type of rot, similarly to dry rot, also has a fungal cause however it is an overarching
                                term that can refer to different fungal species. Wet rot is easier to spot on the facings of the
                                timbers as the process involves the fungus breaking down the wood and causing structural
                                issues both within the timber and possibly further with the property. As the name suggests
                                the main cause of this problem is wood that is in areas with high moisture which in turn
                                causes damp or wet timber and thus attracts the fungus for the process to begin. This
                                means that any issue with water ingress or leaks could lead to issues with wet rot down the
                                line; this means that wet rot can be found where there are also issues with rising or
                                penetrating damp and with condensation.

                                As afore mentioned, if there has been an historical issue with leaks or water
                                ingress to the property there is a higher chance of wet rot becoming an issue; thus keeping
                                an eye on ventilation of the timbers and any structural changes to the floor in the area of
                                the leak. Similarly, to dry rot, wet rot also causes the timbers to smell musty or damp.
                                Another sign to look out for would be darkened spongy timbers, the timbers will look wet to
                                look at and be crumbly or spongy to the touch. There cpuld also be fungal growth in the
                                affected areas but solely on the timber. If you think that this could be an issue in your
                                property, get in touch now.

                                As the name suggests this is the process of beetles finding a home within the timbers of
                                your house. Wood boring beetles leaving holes and eating their way through the timber can
                                cause structural insecurities as well as cracking the wood or further damaging it. The beetles
                                thrive in damp areas and can be a further problem in already in those damp and
                                unventilated areas.

                                with the presence of beetles the wood will become very weak. Another red flag when
                                looking for beetles within the timbers would be tiny circular holes along the wood where
                                the beetles have eaten their way through, this is paired with another key sign which is wood
                                dust or frass; this is the result of the beetles making their way through the wood and comes
                                out as a brown/orange powder or dust.
